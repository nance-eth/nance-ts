    "title": "Renew & (smol) Increase Payout for Nance Project",
    "body": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew and increase funding to the nance Juicebox project for $12,000 per funding cycle for 7 cycles **(total $84,000)**\n\n## Motivation\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNance is a powerful tool that eases governance processes and lowers the administrative overhead of managing a Juicebox project. With this payout renewal, we plan to bring new communities into the Juicebox ecosystem. We will focus on partnerships and business development (BD) as well as building features that allow communities to progressively move from a simple Snapshot+Discord system to governance with cycles, Safe, Juicebox and, finally, on-chain governance. We will focus that effort in ecosystems where Juicebox and Nance are still not present to maximize the growth.\n\n### Team update\n\nNicholas parted ways from Nance in July to pursue other projects. In order to help fulfill his role (and more) Zeugh has joined the team.\n\nZeugh has already hit the ground running in his mixed role of project management, business development, and design.\n\n### What got built?\n\nHere are some updates on what gone done since our last proposal, [JBP-405](/s/juicebox/405)\n\n**Business Development and Growth:**\n\n1.  **Start of BD Mapping Effort** - We have mapped different types of users, needs and approaches to be applied with the goal of bringing Nance as a solution to their governance. The focus so far has been understanding the best type of clients to pursue, aiming at the best ratio between new features needed and new visibility in ecosystem we are not present.\\\n    **![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2wIbOF641oQRC9VxpwzclKC1obU6-JltSVuWh0JjEegZVnF4PqKUuUrytsCl-YPDR_DSPMRYWz-8GVPJUEQjCYbwYgymueUGbzo-fI4FevUh4AqH9vM-71O35VhksK1FSms2fRAWR887x9jfStc1d5g)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQAUwq3k2zEKG6ztkhqb88XShDg5UzHuWPdQC5StBSyUe)**\n2.  **New client acquisition** - [AgroforestDAO](https://agroforestdao.web.app/) and [Africa DeFi Alliance](https://africadefialliance.org/) are two new clients that came from our first effort in growth. Both have Nance defined as their governance integration system, and plan to launch Juicebox projects in the future. For now, they are operating with more basic systems, and will have different uses for Juicebox and Nance as they evolve. Both projects are in ecosystems where Juicebox has a small presence thus we will make good use cases to spread Juicebox to these new areas via Nance.\\\n    \\\n    *AgroforestDAO Goerli Project*\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYxnCokJ7YJEsYR5qVCgAUSGM4FGCZE2zC5LTMehANVPJ)\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbgtoWwbnBCcgCCJC4WbUbk8bCFJhtBfWP6U4Vr1uuvR5)\n3.  **System Architecture mapping for Tutorials** - We created a first analysis of the Nance system, which will be used to make simple tutorials on the new website. This mapping came from the onboarding of the new users described above. It will be used to continue our growth and breakdown what Nance does so we can clearly explain to new DAOs how we can help them manage their governance process.\\\n    **![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6bcH7IB6eNurcer4xJoB0DMyBAC54utTifrudwXmRKBtQsM-cU2EbtAFxqJs5anbqlijuvFgt3uSZZOSWKaSEd_D3Ll8A_OpcfLvAhs88AF9nSgMzUch3xVy7Y4SD8v7t2KLqWtnS_4FP6uOF2ule7A)**\n4.  **Partnership reachouts** - We've established connections with Snapshot, Aragon, Excelsior Labs, TheDAOist, RnDAO and Collab.land DAO, presenting our product, understanding their systems and mapping for future possible partnerships. This work is in different stages with different partners.  \n\n**Product Development and Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Multicall proposal queuing system** - This feature gathers all of the payout and transfer requests from the most recent governance cycle, displays them in a clean easy to review manner, and allows multisig members to queue transactions. Also has built in Tenderly simulation before queuing.\\\n    \\\n    *Reconfigure juicebox project, only showing changed payouts (also capable of showing all payouts and project metadata)*\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNr3d1uvvC4h3Ggakf7WASZsUyM1ehbcgcCsH2EUjciEe) \\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaGjoUaAj57D3A8TgEuyCSPgP4Hc5W6hwWyDL8RZtXiLF)\n2.  **Create space UI** - The create space UI allows for other DAOs to create their own space at [https://nance.app/create](/create). It has Discord, Snapshot, Juicebox project search, and Safe App integration to allow for a user to easily configure everything they need for Nance to run their governance. Recently, jacopo was utilized this page to setup a governance process for <https://slice.so> ([Discord](https://discord.gg/cKRZgJYnqU), [Nance space](/s/Slice)).\\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcKi9Aot79EZTiyctg6bmpXg98cs2t5gXgDw7HYbjqE2Y)\n3.  **Homepage and contact form** - The new homepage launched a few weeks ago and helps explain what Nance does and who is using it. Check it out at [https://nance.app](). We also have a contact form that will post to Discord to help with the acquisition of new Nance users.\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbqYZdgnCCkEKWJUsDpFNKdJqjQm2gw47Xegp4jcLPoEv)\\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQDLd3zUSKcHVNkfcY5rkcnw9vzLMPra64wbGYF4oAcao)\n4.  **User interface guide** - This helps new users gain insight into how to use nance as proposal viewer and proposal writer. Built with [driver.js](https://driverjs.com).\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZt4aghbe9mopoks4ibodH7swqJLzGoBrUwe4tLWzTH5o)\n5.  **Auto generate Table of Contents for proposals** - helpful for navigating long proposals\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZQGKHVzpHktPC3DAH49HmWwPD6NnXT55go5dHnUq2WsZ)\n6.  **View multiple governance cycles** - You can now view proposals from multiple governance cycles at a time\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTwNhrz5YENSrZvHTNfAvWMrzT1owtdLkEHwd2SA6qnAK)\n7.  **More filter vote options -** Filter Snapshot vote viewing by For or Against (feature requested by aeolian)\n8.  **Improved search** - The proposal search abilities improved by adding a better mySQL relevance calculation\n9.  **Speed optimizations** - We were able to greatly improve the speed of nance.app by adding proper data caching on both the frontend and backend as well as removing bulky API calls.\n10. **Database migration to hosted Dolt** - The Nance dolt database is now hosted on <https://hosted.doltdb.com> for $50/month. This is a much more robust and reliable system than the self hosted dolt instance we were using before.\n11. **Nance.app is Safe App compatible** - (feature request by jango)\n\n### What are we planning on doing?\n\n**Business Development:**\n\n1.  **Governance Podcast** - Nothing makes DAO nerds look at you as much as sh\\*tting in their face by showing their governance actually sucks and they are suffering for no reason. We will make a Twitter podcast hosted every 2 weeks by Zeugh, talking to DAO builders and members to understand different governance mechanics in DAOs, map their pros and cons and study how to improve them. Zeugh has already hosted web3 podcasts in the past and got some nice traction with FounderTalk and BRweb3. We will make the summaries of those calls into a database of analysis so we can visualize the different setup possibilities. The goal is to work with different communities so we can position Nance and the Juicebox Ecosystem closer to others working with systems that could benefit from using our tools. \n\n2.  **Initialize RevNet token burning** **model** - We would like to work closely with the RevNet/Retailism team in order to land on a solid token burning model for Nance usage. Need more details on RevNet operating model but excited to explore this world. A part of our vision so far is making sure that projects partnering with JBDAO can run for free on the tokens JBDAO has for supporting Nance development so far, and bringing value back in that treasury with a system of tokens bought/staked/burned (or similar) as needed for usage of the system.\n\n3.  **Nance Demos and Office Hours** - Zeugh will be available at Nance Discord/Nance Twitter/JB Discord in different times of the week for support with Nance and governance in general. He will also be hosting demo sessions for new space creators and answering async questions about Nance to have a fast feedback loop on first new clients.\n\n4.  **Onboarding Docs** - Creating the \"How it Works\" session of nance.app, explaining the system in both a simple and technical version. This is a continuation of the effort described in \\*\\*Business Development and Growth \\*\\*point 2.\n\n5.  **DAOs reachout (3 Waves)**- We will create new touchpoints with 90 new DAOs in the next 3 months, divided in 3 waves.\n\n    1.  Personal reach out:\n\n        10 DAOs over 2 weeks, reaching out to founders and builders in our network that can benefit from nance and help us understand what pains we can help solve outside a JBDAO model. \n\n    2.  Good match reach out:\n\n        20 DAOs that we consider a good fit, over 4 weeks, reaching out through Zeugh bizdev network to DAOs that we consider good matches for our service, with the goal of building them a Nance Space and improving their governance by Snapshot <> Discord integration at first moment\n\n    3.  Easy-fit cold out reach:\n\n        60 DAOs, 6 weeks, reaching out to DAOs we have no connection with through discord and twitter, offering them the self onboard to integrate Snapshot and Disc through Nance by themselves and making ourselves available for support if needed. Goal here is to try product market fit independently from our influence.\n\n6.  **Integration Partnerships** - We are on the move to integrate Jokerace to our system, and we will actively pursue partnerships and integrations with more systems that can benefit from the seamless flow of Nance and/or the governance cycle structure. The goal is to bring users of other products to the network and let the magic of Juicebox, Nance and Revnets show them that they found the right place. First goal is Jokerace, followed by Aragon and Collab.land.\n\n**Product Development and Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Launch a Juicebox Project** **action** - A Nance action to create a Juicebox project will help bring new DAOs into the Juicebox ecosystem by providing a simple template for them to launch their own Juicebox project. We will have a short list of templates for users that want a Juicebox project but do not want to think about all of the intricacies of reserve rate, reduction rate, or redemption rate. These are things that a more advance user can opt into later if they please. A basic project with a 14 day funding cycle, basic token rules, a 3 day reconfiguration delay, and promote the concept of having more than 1 payout on the project.\n2.  **Launch a Jokerace action** - Jokerace is a very popular platform created by [David Phelps](https://twitter.com/divine_economy) and [Sean McCaffery](https://twitter.com/seanmc_eth) and partial funded by Juicebox from [JBP-211](/s/juicebox/211). They have a new system that allows contest creates to attach rewards that are distributed to the top submissions. We plan to create a Nance action that launches a Jokerace with the reward of a Juicebox project (launched by the efforts from point 1). This will be another great way to spread Juicebox to those outside of the ecosystem.\n3.  **Link Discord for tagged alerts** - When submitting a proposal, user's will be able to link their Discord and opt in to tagged alerts for expiring payout proposals.\n4.  **Edit space** - Currently no way to edit a space setting in the UI, this is one of the first thing users need help with after creating a space. This is essential for onboarding new users in a seamless fashion.\n5.  **Edit Juicebox Project Settings** - This will allow for a Nance space to submit a proposal that edits the settings of their Juicebox project (to support all features under Advanced tab on <https://juicebox.money> settings page) \n6.  **Continue performance improvements** - We plan to continue our efforts of speed optimizations and bug squashing on the frontend and backend. This is another essential component of making a good experience for new Nance users. Without it new users may deem the app too slow and look for alternatives.\n\n## Specification\n\n*Note: The [nance juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/477) is owned by a 2/3 multisig with jigglyjams, twodam, and zeugh as the signers.*\n\nThe main use of the funds will be to pay our contributors:\n\n1.  jigglyjams - $4,500/cycle\n2.  twodam - $5,000/cycle\n3.  zeugh - $2,500/cycle\\\n    \\===================\\\n    **TOTAL request $12,000/cycle**\n\n## Risks\n\nThe nance team may fail to do this job properly\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n*   The Nance team of zeugh, twodam, and jigglyjams have been meeting regularly (Nancehall is every week alternating between 1AM and 1PM UTC, [see nance discord for details](https://discord.gg/eHv5kwbgGE)) to further speed up the development process of the platform\n*   Zeugh's experience in the DAO space over the last year gives us a really good position to get Nance in the hands of many DAOs\n*   Twodam is always working on new features and optimizations of the frontend\n*   Jigglyjam is always thinking about more scalable bot solutions, improving Discord alerts, and optimizing manual administrative processes\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal shall take effect in GC#59\n",

    "title": "$120k to Bananapus",
    "body": "## Synopsis\n\nJuicebox projects will be able to offer cross-chain incentives by end of November, with multi-cycle queuing, staking rewards, and a few more accounting/integration benefits alongside.\n\nThe Bananapus end game spec is now clear: It will deploy a slightly updated version of the Juicebox protocol onto ETH mainnet and Optimism, and collect 2.5% protocol fees into its $NANA revnet (<https://revnet.eth.limo>) operated by the $JBX multisig. It will include its flagship staking mechanism called Tentacles that facilitate cross-chain financial alignment between networks and organizations.\n\nThe remaining todo's and the necessary budget to staff us through the finish line safely are also clear. This proposal is for a $120,000 grant to pay for NANA testing and audit contests, and an invitation to the Juicebox community to support its go-to-market moment.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor updates and quick links, keep up with [https://bananapus.eth.limo.](https://bananapus.eth.limo)\n\n### Technical todo list:\n\n#### **Finish Juicebox V3 fork**\n\nTLDR: The fork will allow for multi-cycle queuing, multi-currency accounting within a cycle, bring-your-own price feed, and a handful of other accounting and integration optimizations.\n\nNeed: The following PRs need to be tested and thoroughly reviewed: <https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-contracts-v4/pulls>.\n\nStaff: Lead by nowonder and Jango, supported by nowonder and DrGorilla.\n\nBudget: $40k, managed by Jango.\n\n#### **Finish staking mechanism**\n\nTLDR: Staking allows the distribution of rewards between networks and organizations across chains.\n\nNeed: The following repos aren't yet tested in production and need to be reviewed by external developers after internal touchups:\n\n*   Staking: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-721-staking-delegate> - Create a staked position\n*   Periodic reward claiming: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-distributor> - Distribution rewards to stakers of particular tokens who check in on a periodic basis.\n*   Tentacles: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-tentacles> - Claim rewards across chains.\n\nStaff: Lead by 0xBa5ed and Jango, supported by nowonder and DrGorilla.\n\nBudget: $40k, managed by Jango.\n\n#### **Finish baseline Bananapus.com**\n\nTLDR: bananapus.com is the webclient that give access to the Bananapus staking mechanism for rewards and tentacle management.\n\nNeed: Shore up the reliability and user experience of the site. The repo is at <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus.com>\n\nStaff: Lead by filip, needs help.\n\nBudget: $20k, managed by filip.\n\n### Organizational todo list:\n\n*Misc organizational overhead has the remaining budget of $20k, managed by Jango.*\n\n#### Finalize revnet specs\n\n\\*For an intro to revnets, see <https://revnet.eth.limo/about/> \\*\\\n\\\nThe $NANA revnet on Ethereum mainnet will have the following specifications. These are subject to change and need finalization:\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Property**            | **Value**                                                                                                            |\n| Initial issuance        | 1,000 $NANA / ETH                                                                                                    |\n| Issuance reduction rate | 2.5% every 28 days                                                                                                   |\n| Premint                 | 37,000,000 $NANA to dao.jbx.eth ($JBX currently has a \\~37,000 ratio between its issuance rate and its total supply) |\n| Boost                   | 30% operated by dao.jbx.eth for 3 years.                                                                             |\n| Exit tax curve          | 10%                                                                                                                  |\n\nThe $opNANA revnet on Optimism will have the following specifications:\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Property**            | **Value**                                                                                                                                               |\n| Initial issuance        | 1,000 $opNANA / ETH                                                                                                                                     |\n| Issuance reduction rate | 2.5% every 28 days                                                                                                                                      |\n| Premint                 | 37,000,000 $opNANA to dao.jbx.eth ($JBX currently has a \\~37,000 ratio between its issuance rate and its total supply)                                  |\n| Boost                   | 30% operated by dao.jbx.eth for 3 years, initially set at 20% to $opNANA stakers, and 10% to $NANA:OP (mainnet staked $NANA on Optimism via a tentacle) |\n| Exit tax curve          | 10%                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Specification\n\n*$120k grant to NANA JB project.*\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*NANA technical components will only go live when everyone feels very good about it.
